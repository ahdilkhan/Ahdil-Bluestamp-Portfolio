For my optical character recognition project, I utilized a Raspberry Pi + PiCamera to develop an efficent device capable of converting an image of text into machine-readable text format. For instance, if you were to scan a receipt, your computer saves the scan as an image file and then uses OCR technology to read the text. This technology is especially useful for self-driving cars since it is able to read number plates and road signs.

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

For my first milestone, I set up the hardware components of my Raspberry Pi such as the case, USB wires and power cable connecting to the PI. Problems I ran into while doing this was setting up the fan to make sure the heatsinks on the motherboard don't overheat. I wasn't sure how/where to set up the fan in the Raspberry Pi but through youtube tutorials, I was able to figure out how to connect it and have it start working. After the hardware setup, I was able to flash the SD card with the Raspberry Pi OS and wifi configuration. Then, I was able to remotely connect the Raspberry Pi through SSH and with the connection via VNC viewer, we did not need a keyboard or mouse connection. Originally, I was not able to connect through VNC viewer due to a error that said connection refused. I watched a youtube tutorial that mentioned that you have to enable VNC server on the Raspberry Pi before the VNC viewer connection. Lastly, I used VS code to write a small python script to test if I can push the code into Raspberry Pi which worked successfully. My next steps in completing the project is getting the PiCamera set up as well as get to the begenning stages of setting up the OCR software. 

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
